                Web service is one of the key communications software services for the
                Internet. Web phishing is one of many security threats to web services
                on the Internet.

                The recipient is then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can
                lead to the installation of malware, the freezing of the system as part
                of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive information.

                  Understanding if the website is a valid one or not is important and plays a vital role in securing the data.
                  To know if the URL is a valid one or your information is at risk, check your website.

              <p>
                As a report from the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) revealed earlier this year, there has been a notable rise in the number phishing attacks.
                It's a widespread problem, posing a huge risk to individuals and organizations.<br />
                Follow the tips below and stay better protected against phishing attacks.

                <h3>Browse securely with HTTPS</h3>
                <p>
                  You should always, where possible, use a secure website indicated by https:// and a security ‚Äúlock‚Äù icon in the browser‚Äôs address bar to browse, and especially when submitting sensitive information online, such as credit card details.
                </p>

                <h3>Watch out for shortened links</h3>
                <p>
                  Cybercriminals often use these ‚Äì from Bitly and other shortening services ‚Äì to trick you into thinking you are clicking a legitimate link, when in fact you‚Äôre being inadvertently directed to a fake site.

                <h3>Does that email look suspicious? Read it again</h3>
                <p>
                  Plenty of phishing emails are fairly obvious. They will be punctuated with plenty of typos, words in capitals and exclamation marks!

                <h3>Be wary of threats and urgent deadlines</h3>
                <p>
                  Some of these threats may include notices about a fine, or advising you to do something to stop your account from being closed. Ignore the scare tactics and contact the company separately via a known and trusted channel.
